# githubCommits
This small app was built to learn the basics of vue.js. It shows the most recent commits on [this](https://github.com/kjmj/tic-tac-toe) github repository.

It uses the github api to query for the specified repo. Just change the `apiURL` field in `script.js` to query for another repo.
